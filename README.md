**Application**

This is a simple API for a Book store implementing the different CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete).
Architectural Design.
The primary idea behind Clean Architecture is to make the solution adaptive, keep the core business or application logic use cases independent of frontend and external frameworks. A major advantage of this approach is that it facilitates a separation of concerns since it separates the User Interafce, Business Logic, and Data Access. This separation significantly reduces coupling since each layer implements dependencies/ modules required by itself. Additionally, dependenices within this organization structure flow inward toward the application core which makes it easier to perform both unit and integration tests.
